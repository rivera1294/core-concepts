#What is a session

A cookie is a piece of data the server sends to the browser. The browser can store that cookei data. Once the cookie data is stored, if the browser returns to the same server at a later time the server will take the cookie data that the browser has stored and it will customize the data it sends back to the client based off the cookie it recieved.

An example of this is when a user signs into facebook. The user signs in and the facebook servers will send the browser some cookie data. If the user closes the window without logging out and returns to facebook again, then facebook will automatically show the users newsfeed. This happened because facebook took the cookie data it orginally gave the browser when the user first signed in then read the cookie data and recognized who the user was. Therefore showing the user their newsfeed instead of the sign up page.
